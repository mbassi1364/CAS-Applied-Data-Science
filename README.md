### Data-Science-Project

Project after modules 1 and 2. Its objective is to apply the methodes and
prinicples learned in the modules, to a data science problem, and to present the
results.

The data science problem chosen was to compare metrics gathered from two database
platforms. One platform seemed to suffer from performance degradation after a
platform upgrade, an the goal was to confirm or proof wrong this suspicion.


### Machine-Learning-Project

Project after module 3. Apply machine learning techniques to a data science project.

The technique used was association mining, applied to wait event frequencies on a
database platform.


### Module-1

Jupyter notebook exercise from module 1.

### Module-2

Is empty


### Module-4

Artefacts from lecture _Software Documentation Techniques_


### Module-5

Report for Peer Consulting Task, for G.Binders project *Uhren lesen*.


### Peer-Consulting-Project

A project implemented using Python, and used as input for Peer Consulting Task.

The project analyses User I/O metrics from a database platform, before and after
deployment of a new production release. Techniques from modules 1 and 2 are
applied to provide evidence for User I/O degradation, monitored after
deployment.
